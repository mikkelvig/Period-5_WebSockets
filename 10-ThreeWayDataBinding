Explain and demonstrate “three-way data binding” using Firebase and Angular

In AngularJS our scope model and view stay in sync thanks to the two way data binding (ng-model). When using
FireBase as a backend, three way binding is possible. You can bind your model data to a FireBase location, so that
whenever your models change, those changes are automatically pushed to FireBase. Similarly, whenever the data at the
particular FireBase location changes, your local scope model is also updated. This creates a three way data binding.
The obvious benefit is that it lets you create cool realtime apps where the data changes frequently and those
modifications are broadcast to all the connected users.
