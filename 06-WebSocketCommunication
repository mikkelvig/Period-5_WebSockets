Explain and demonstrate the process of WebSocket communication - From connecting client to server,
through sending messages, to closing connection.


Browser send a request to server to upgrade HTTP to Web Socket and if the Server supports Websocket, it send an
response saying ok I am upgrading your HTTP to a single long running HTTP connection. Thereafter browser and server
starts send data frames in both directions over a TCP socket. The WebSocket protocol is designed for scenarios where
messages need to be exchanged between browser and server at a high frequency. Yet, there are significant challenges
since a majority of deployed browsers that do not support WebSockets.
