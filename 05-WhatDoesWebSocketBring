Explain what the WebSocket Protocol brings to the Web-world.

Normally when a browser visits a web page, an HTTP request is sent to the web server that hosts that page. The web
server acknowledges this request and sends back the response. In many cases—for example, for stock prices, news
reports, ticket sales, traffic patterns, medical device readings, and so on—the response could be stale by the time
the browser renders the page. If you want to get the most up-to-date "real-time" information, you can constantly
refresh that page manually, but that's obviously not a great solution.
