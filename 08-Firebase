What is Backend as a Service, Database as a Service, why would you consider using Firebase in your projects?

Firebase provides a realtime database and backend as a service. The service provides application developers an API
that allows application data to be synchronized across clients and stored on Firebase's cloud. The company provides
client libraries that enable integration with Android, iOS, JavaScript, Java, Objective-C and Node.js applications.
The database is also accessible through a REST API and bindings for several JavaScript frameworks such as AngularJS,
React, Ember.js and Backbone.js. The REST API uses the Server-Sent Events protocol, which is an API for creating
HTTP connections for receiving push notifications from a server. Developers using the realtime database can secure
their data by using the company's server-side-enforced security rules.
