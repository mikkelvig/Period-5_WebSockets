What is HTTP streaming, SSE (Server sent events)?

With streaming, the browser sends a complete request, but the server sends and maintains an open response that is
continuously updated and kept open indefinitely (or for a set period of time). The response is then updated whenever
a message is ready to be sent, but the server never signals to complete the response, thus keeping the connection
open to deliver future messages. Streaming includes HTTP headers which increases the file size, increasing delay.
This can be considered as a major drawback.
