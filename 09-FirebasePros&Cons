Explain the pros & cons of using a Backend as a Service Provider like Firebase.

Pros:
- A lot of Realtime functionality is built for you (three-way binding, sockets etc.).
- Built-in Database (JSON) and hosting.
- Built-in Scaling
- Built-in Security.
- Cross Platform API (for Web, IOS, Android and utilize REST as well)


Cons:
- You will be relying on Firebase, and if Firebase is down, the same will be the case for your service
- Vendor lock-in (will be a huge headache to migrate to another service)
- Probably cheaper to self-host and build your own backend
