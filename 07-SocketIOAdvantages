What's the advantage of using libraries like Socket.IO, Sock.JS, WS, over pure WebSocket libraries in the backend
and standard APIs on frontend? Which problems do they solve?


Socket.IO is an event-based bi-directional communication layer for realtime web applications, built atop Engine.IO.
It abstracts many transports, including AJAX long-polling and WebSockets, into a single API. It allows developers to
send and receive data without worrying about cross-browser compatibility.

Advantages:

Socket.IO provides both server-side and client-side components with similar APIs.
It allows developers to send and receive data without worrying about cross-browser compatibility.
Fallbacks to polling with incompatible browsers.
