What is WebSocket protocol, how is it different from HTTP communication, what advantages does it have over HTTP?


Ultimately, all of these methods (polling, long-polling and http streaming) involve HTTP request and response headers,
which contain lots of additional, unnecessary header data and introduce latency. Full-duplex connectivity requires
more than just the downstream connection from server to client. In an effort to simulate full-duplex communication
over half-duplex HTTP, many of today's solutions use two connections: one for the downstream and one for the
upstream. The maintenance and coordination of these two connections introduces significant overhead in terms of
resource consumption and adds lots of complexity.
Simply put, HTTP wasn't designed for real-time, full-duplex communication.

HTML5 Web Sockets represents the next evolution of web communicationsâ€”a full-duplex, bidirectional communications
channel that operates through a single socket over the Web. HTML5 Web Sockets provides a true standard that you can
use to build scalable, real-time web applications. In addition, since it provides a socket that is native to the
browser, it eliminates many of the problems Comet solutions are prone to. Web Sockets removes the overhead and
dramatically reduces complexity.
