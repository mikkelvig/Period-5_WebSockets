Name attributes of HTTP protocol makes it difficult to use for real time systems.


Current attempts to provide real-time web applications largely revolve around polling and other server-side push

to the client. Comet-based push is generally implemented in JavaScript and uses connection strategies such as
long-polling or streaming.
